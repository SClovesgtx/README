### 1 - Short Biography

I was born and raised in the Brazil countryside, passionate about exact sciences, a guy who did not succeed finishing his Statistics graduation at IME-USP (I'm a dropout) but keep studying math as a hobby.


### 2 - What can I do?

 * Descriptive analysis of numerical and textual data (Python, R).
 * Dashboards and reports (Python, Kibana, AWS SageMaker and Watson Studio).
 * ETL processes.
 * NLP model training (ANNs, BM25, LDA, etc).
 * Chatbots development (Watson Assistent, Omni NLP API).
 * RESTful APIs (Flask)

### 3 - What are my interests?


* **Mathematics and Statistics**: Even though I'm not the genius of math, this is the area of knowledge that interests me most. I am always reading, watching a documentary or taking a course related to physics, mathematics, statistics and probability. My favorite channels on these topics are [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman), [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw), and [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile).

* **Artificial Intelligence**: I am more specifically interested in the AI subarea that is concerned with machine learning (ML). I know conceptually the main ML models and I feel comfortable enough to apply them.

* **Music**: I really like instrumental music and Brazilian Popular Music. I play percussion instruments, guitar and cavaquinho. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx3BUHaibDI) to see me playing.

* **Languages**: I like to study languages. I'm a big fan of the [Langfocus](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNhX3WQEkraW3VHPyup8jkQ) channel. I am currently studying German and one of its dialects here in Brazil called [Hunsrückisch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunsr%C3%BCckisch_dialect).

* **Write**: I like to write about things I learn. [Here](https://medium.com/me/stories/public) some of my articles on Medium.
