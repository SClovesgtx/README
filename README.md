# Who am I?

I have been working in the technology field since 2017. Currently, I am a mix of Software Developer and Data Analyst working at [Extreme Digital Solution](https://www2.extremedigital.com.br/).

# What languages do I use?

- **Python**: This is my main language and the one I use at work.
- **JavaScript and TypeScript**: These are languages used in some of the projects at my job, and although I am not familiar with them, I am able to manage some maintenance work.
