### What are my interests?


* **Mathematics and Statistics**: I'm not a genius of math but this is the area of knowledge that I have a crush on. My favorite channels on these topics are [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman), [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw), and [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile).

* **Machine Learning**: I know conceptually the main ML models and I feel comfortable enough to apply them. My favorite channels on these topics are [StatQuest with Josh Starmer](https://www.youtube.com/user/joshstarmer) and [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex).

* **Music**: I really like instrumental music and Brazilian Popular Music. I play percussion instruments, guitar and cavaquinho. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx3BUHaibDI) to see me playing.

* **Languages**: I have fun studing languages and I am currently studying German and one of its dialects here in Brazil called [Hunsr√ºckisch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunsr%C3%BCckisch_dialect). I'm a big fan of the [Langfocus](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNhX3WQEkraW3VHPyup8jkQ) channel.

* **Write**: I like to write about things that I'm learning. [Here](https://medium.com/me/stories/public) are some of my articles on Medium.
