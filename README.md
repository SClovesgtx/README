# Who am I?

My name is Cloves Paiva, I am 33 years old, married, and I have been working in the technology field since 2017. Currently, I am a software developer at [Extreme Digital Solution](https://www2.extremedigital.com.br/).

Although I studied statistics for three years at [IME-USP](https://www.ime.usp.br/), I dropped out and worked as a Data Analyst for five years. As time went by, my interest in software development grew, and **now all my study efforts are focused on this area**.

# What languages do I use?

- **Python**: This is my main language and the one I use at work.
- **Cython**: Recently, I have been studying this Python superset to use it in the development of the [fuzzCy](https://github.com/SClovesgtx/fuzzCy) library that I'm streaming every Saturday on my Twitch channel [ClovesPy](https://www.twitch.tv/clovespy/videos).
- **Java**: I am currently taking my third consecutive course on the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) platform, where the language used to present the concepts is Java, and I am starting to become familiar with it.
- **JavaScript and TypeScript**: These are languages used in some of the projects at my job, and although I am not familiar with them, I am able to manage some maintenance work.
