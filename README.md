# Who am I?

My name is Cloves Paiva, I'm 33 years old, married and I've been working in the technology field since 2016.

I am currently a software developer at [Extreme Digital Solution](https://www.linkedin.com/company/extremedigitalsolutions/).

I studied statistics for 3 years at IME-USP (I'm a dropout) and therefore, for 4 years of my life, I worked in the data area.

As time went by, I started to get more and more involved with software development and today all my study efforts are focused on this area.

# What languages do I use?

- **Python**: this is my main language and the one I use at work.

- **Cython**: Recently I've been studying this Python *superset* to use it in the development of the [fuzzCy](https://github.com/SClovesgtx/fuzzCy) library that I'm streaming every Saturday.
- **Java**: I'm already on the third course in a row on the [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) platform where the language used to present the concepts is Java, so I'm starting to get familiar with it .
